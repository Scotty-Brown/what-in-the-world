## üå± Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- Project planning, time management and working within the scope of expectations.
- I broke up all of my major tasks into smaller, digestible pieces. This allowed me to iterate through the project without any major blockers.

Challenges:
- One of my biggest challenges was determining the architecture of the app that made the most sense.
- This was my first time working with an API I found in the 'wild'. I quickly realized that I would need to spend some time studying the data and determining the best way to interact and capture the pieces that I wanted to use in my application. This was a great learning experience and exposure to public API's.
